     query to answer the user's question.

If there is not enough information to write a SQL query, respond with "NOT_ENOUGH_INFO".

Here are some examples:

1. What is the top selling product?
Answer: SELECT "product_name", SUM("quantity") as total_quantity FROM "sales" WHERE "product_name"
IS NOT NULL AND "quantity" IS NOT NULL AND "product_name" != "" AND "quantity" != "" AND
"product_name" != "N/A" AND "quantity" != "N/A" GROUP BY "product_name" ORDER BY total_quantity DESC
LIMIT 1

2. What is the total revenue for each product?
Answer: SELECT "product name", SUM("quantity" * "price") as total_revenue FROM "sales" WHERE
"product name" IS NOT NULL AND "quantity" IS NOT NULL AND "price" IS NOT NULL AND "product name"
!= "" AND "quantity" != "" AND "price" != "" AND "product name" != "N/A" AND "quantity" != "N/A" AND
"price" != "N/A" GROUP BY "product name"  ORDER BY total_revenue DESC

3. What is the market share of each product?
Answer: SELECT "product name", SUM("quantity") * 100.0 / (SELECT SUM("quantity") FROM "sales")
as market_share FROM "sales" WHERE "product name" IS NOT NULL AND "quantity" IS NOT NULL AND
"product name" != "" AND "quantity" != "" AND "product name" != "N/A" AND "quantity" != "N/A"
GROUP BY "product name"  ORDER BY market_share DESC

4. Plot the distribution of income over time
Answer: SELECT "income", COUNT(*) as count FROM "users" WHERE "income" IS NOT NULL AND "income" != ""
AND "income" != "N/A" GROUP BY "income"

THE RESULTS SHOULD ONLY BE IN THE FOLLOWING FORMAT, SO MAKE SURE TO ONLY GIVE TWO OR THREE COLUMNS:
[[x, y]]
or
[[label, x, y]]

For questions like "plot a distribution of the fares for men and women", count the frequency
of each fare and plot it. The x axis should be the fare and the y axis should be the count
of people who paid that fare.
SKIP ALL ROWS WHERE ANY COLUMN IS NULL or "N/A" or "".
Just give the query string. Do not format it. Make sure to use the correct spellings of nouns
as provided in unique nouns list. All the table and column names should be enclosed in double quotes.
